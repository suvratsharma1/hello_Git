<!-- to igore a file we have to create a .gitignore folder first -->
<!-- and then we have to put the file names which are to be ignored -->
<!-- keeping in mind that the files must be untracked  -->
<!-- if we want to ignore all files of type .txt  -->
  write "*.txt" in the gitignore file 
<!-- to untrack a tracked file  -->
 write "git rm --cached <filename>"
    <!-- "git rm <filename>" remove the file from staging area and working directory   -->

        <!-- while the "--cached" helps us in keeping the file in our working directosy and only removing from the github -->
